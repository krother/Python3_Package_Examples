# Numpy

### What it is good for?

Numpy makes it easy to work with matrices in Python.

Because it is implemented in C, `numpy` accelerates many calculations. It is also type-safe - all elements of a matrix have the same type. Many of the most powerful Python libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `PILLOW` have been built on top of numpy.
