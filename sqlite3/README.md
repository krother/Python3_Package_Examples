# sqlite3

### What it is good for?

Create and use a *SQLite* database.

SQLite is a very straightforward SQL database. 
In contrast to MySQL or PostGreSQL, the data is stored in a single file.
For using the `sqlite3` module you don't need to install or set up anything. 

SQLite is sufficient only for small SQL databases, but Python modules for bigger databases look very similar.
